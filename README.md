## Ah\!  The Boss Is Coming\!


</div>

### Description

Ever been in one of those situations when you are doing something on the computer, banned by every rule, and then your boss walks round the corner? This is the answer to all those problems! As soon as you see him, simply click and your screen is covered with a graph and textboxes making it look as if you are actually working! Could this be the end to sackings because of computer misuse? Don't know but it's saved me a couple of times! Hope you enjoy it!
